# AshleeBeacom_Portfolio
Welcome to my data analytics portfolio!

I am a student at Dakota State University in the Analytics and Applied Artificial Intelligence MSAA program. I have experience working with Python, R, SQL, Excel, Power BI, and Tableau. I have also done some work in Julia and C. I have a good understanding of techniques such as data mining, data cleaning, data visualization, statistics, and analysis. 

This portfolio includes projects in Python, SQL, and R that demonstrate my analytics skills. There are also links to Tableau and Power BI that show my ability to present data visually in a way that is easy for viewers to understand. Beyond my technical expertise, I am a strategic problem solver. I am confident in my skills and my dedication and ability to learn new skills at every opportunity.

# About Me
I am originally from Sioux Falls, SD. I have bachelors degrees in biology and chemistry from Black Hills State University and an undergraduate certificate in analytics from Dakota State University. I have been a team player my whole life, even going on to play basketball for Black Hill State University for 5 years. Since leaving the court in 2022 I have turned to running. Currently, I am training for my fifth marathon. As a big adventurer, I love the outdoors and spending time in nature. My favorite thing to do after a long day is cuddle with my cats, Pogo, Pickle, and Pride, and catch up on the latest Survivor episode or read a good fantasy.
