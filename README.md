# AshleeBeacom_Portfolio
Welcome to my data analytics portfolio!

I am a student at Dakota State University in the Analytics and Applied Artificial Intelligence MSAA program. I have experience working with Python, R, SQL, Excel, Power BI and Tableau. I have a good understanding of techniques such as data mining, data cleaning, data visualization, statistics, and analysis. 

This portfolio includes projects in Excel, Python, SQL, and R that demonstrate my analytics skills. There is also a link to Tableau Public that shows my ability to present data visually in a way that is easy for viewers to understand. The work posted here is a combination of school and personal projects. Beyond my technical expertise, I am a strategic problem solver. I am confident in my skills, dedication and ability to learn new skills at every opportunity.

# Projects
### Bike Sales Project -
This project was done in Excel. This project highlights data cleaning, pivot tables, charts, and dashboard creation. It analyzes bike store data to uncover customer demographics, providing valuable insights into the store's target audience and purchasing trends.

### Energy Project -
This project was done in Python. It showcases data cleaning, analysis, and interpretation.

Included Libraries: numpy, pandas, seaborn, and matplotlib

Questions to be answered: What continent generates the most renewable energy? Why country? Is the overall trend of the world going towards generating more renewable energy?

### Guitar Shop Project -
This project was done in SQL. It demonstrates sales analytics using SQL queries to derive business insights. There are 10 specific questions stated that give insight into product performance, reveneue analysis, and customer behavior.  

### Harvest Yield Project -
This project was done in R. This project demonstrates statistical programming, merging data, data normalization, and data visualization.

Included Libraries: moments, bnlearn, and Rgraphviz

Questions to be answered: Does the previous year's yield affect the future yields on the same field?

### National Park Project -
This project was done in Python. It demonstrates data engineering with a custom dataset (small: 4 columns by 20 rows), data exploration, and visualization.

Included Libraries: numpy, pandas, and matplotlib

Questions to be answered: Does the amount of trails in a National Park affect the number of quests that visit? Does the total area of a National Park affect the number of guests that visit?

### Neural Network -
This is a project done in Python. It demonstrates predictive analytics using a neural network. This was my part of a larger group project done for a class. 

Included Libraries: numpy, pandas, sklearn, tensorflow.keras, imblearn, seaborn, and matplotlib

Questions to be answered: Can a neural netweork predict the system's health based on the radar signal strength, sonar distance, and infrared temperatures?

# About Me
I am originally from Sioux Falls, SD. After finishing my undergraduate studies, I traveled around the country and world working different seasonal jobs. This includes at a ropes course in the Outer Banks, North Carolina and at a luxury hotel in Rovaniemi, Finland. I lived in Finland from September 2022 - May 2025. I have been a team player my whole life, leading to go on to play basketball for Black Hill State University for 5 years. Since leaving the court in 2022, I have turned to running. Now, to put my competitive spirit to use, I am training for my sixth marathon and hope to one day qualify for the Boston Marathon. As a big adventurer, I love the outdoors and spending time in nature. My favorite things to do after work are cuddle with my cats, work on a current knit/crochet projects, watch the latest Survivor episode, or read a good fantasy book.
