# AshleeBeacom_Portfolio
Welcome to my data analytics portfolio!

I am a student at Dakota State University in the Analytics and Applied Artificial Intelligence MSAA program. I have experience working with Python, R, SQL, Excel, and Tableau. I have also have limited experience working with Julia, C, and Power BI. I have a good understanding of techniques such as data mining, data cleaning, data visualization, statistics, and analysis. 

This portfolio includes projects in Python, SQL, and R that demonstrate my analytics skills. There are also links to Tableau and Power BI that show my ability to present data visually in a way that is easy for viewers to understand. The work posted here was done for my studies or personal projects. Beyond my technical expertise, I am a strategic problem solver. I am confident in my skills and my dedication and ability to learn new skills at every opportunity.

# Projects
### Energy Project -
This project was done in Python. It showcases data cleaning, analysis, and interpretation.
Included Libraries: numpy, pandas, seaborn, and matplotlib
Questions to be answered: What continent generates the most renewable energy? Why country? Is the overall trend of the world going towards generating more renewable energy?

### Guitar Shop Project -
This project was done in SQL. It demonstrates sales analytics using SQL queries to derive business insights. There are 10 specific questions stated that give insight into product performance, reveneue analysis, and customer behavior.  

### Harvest Yield Project -
This project was done in R. This project demonstrates statistical programming, merging data, data normalization, and data visualization.
Included Libraries: moments, bnlearn, and Rgraphviz
Questions to be answered: Does the previous year's yield affect the future yields on the same field?

### National Park Project -
This project was done in Python. It demonstrates data engineering with a custom dataset (small: 4 columns by 20 rows), data exploration, and visualization.
Included Libraries: numpy, pandas, and matplotlib
Questions to be answered: Does the amount of trails in a National Park affect the number of quests that visit? Does the total area of a National Park affect the number of guests that visit?

### Neural Network -
This is a project done in Python. It demonstrates predictive analytics using a neural network. This was my part of a larger group project done for a class. 
Included Libraries: numpy, pandas, sklearn, tensorflow.keras, imblearn, seaborn, and matplotlib
Questions to be answered: Can a neural netweork predict the system's health based on the radar signal strength, sonar distance, and infrared temperatures?

### Tableau

# About Me
I am originally from Sioux Falls, SD. I have bachelors degrees in biology and chemistry from Black Hills State University and an undergraduate certificate in analytics from Dakota State University. I have been a team player my whole life, even going on to play basketball for Black Hill State University for 5 years. Since leaving the court in 2022 I have turned to running. Currently, I am training for my fifth marathon. As a big adventurer, I love the outdoors and spending time in nature. My favorite thing to do after a long day is cuddle with my cats, Pogo, Pickle, and Pride, watch the latest Survivor episode, or read a good fantasy book.
